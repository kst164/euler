# Intro

Me learning Rust by solving problems on [Project Euler](https://www.projecteuler.net)

Also first time using git

### script.sh
Just to change which problem file is executed

### primes
A small library I wrote to provide a PrimeTools struct that provides some prime number related functionality (```iter```, ```is_prime```, ```factorize```, etc.)
